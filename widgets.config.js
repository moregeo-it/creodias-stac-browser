First, cloud masking based on the scene classification layer of the Sentinel-2 level 2 algorithm was applied, then for each pixel and band, within three-month time periods, the first quartile of the distribution of the pixel values was taken as the output value to filter out any bright pixels misclassified as not clouds. If there are no valid pixels for the given timeframe, the pixel is left empty. Sentinel-2 cloudless mosaics can be used for various purposes such as land cover classification, land use planning, or for the creation of basemaps. These images are especially useful for showing large and cloudy areas with interesting large-scale patterns. Iceland is a prime example, with frequent cloud cover and large areal extent spanning several Sentinel-2 swaths.",

Level-1 SLC products are images in the slant range by azimuth imaging plane, in the image plane of satellite data acquisition. Each image pixel is represented by a complex (I and Q) magnitude value and therefore contains both amplitude and phase information. Each I and Q value is 16 bits per pixel. The processing for all SLC products results in a single look in each dimension using the full available signal bandwidth. The imagery is geo-referenced using orbit and attitude data from the satellite. SLC images are produced in a zero Doppler geometry. This convention is common with the standard slant range products available from other SAR sensors.",

            "description": "This dataset refers to the CORINE Land Cover Plus Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry Instance (CLCplus LULUCF Instance), an annually updated, pan-European, spatially consistent and seamless geospatial proxy for land use reporting under the LULUCF regulation. The product is delivered as a single raster layer with a spatial resolution of 100 m, derived from multiple pan-European Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) high resolution input datasets. The LULUCF Instance is available for the reference years 2018, 2021, 2022 and 2023, with production moving to an annual update cycle starting from the 2021 product. \nEach raster cell represents a dominant LULUCF land-use class, assigned according to thematic and spatial rulesets implemented during the extraction process. While each pixel corresponds primarily to one of the six main LULUCF land use categories - forest land, grassland, cropland, settlements, wetlands, and other lands - the dataset further differentiates these categories into sub classes, resulting in a total of 27 classes. This classification structure supports greenhouse gas reporting and other applications within the LULUCF sector by providing a harmonised and policy relevant representation of land use across Europe. \nThis product is fundamentally different from other CLMS products, as it is not based directly on satellite image classification or visual interpretation. Instead, it is produced through the combination and integration of existing CLMS data layers. Consequently, the dataset does not introduce fundamentally new information; rather, its novelty lies in the expert driven integration of multiple sources to produce a LULUCF oriented land use representation.",
